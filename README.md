# Registration-form
This is some fun project about a registration form written in html, integrated with a MySQL Database where the u/reg details are stored. It's run initially using app.py.
Feel free to play around with it and create better visuals.
Understand that if you wish to run this project, you MUST add the app.py in the root directory, add the reg_form, reg_success and reg_error in the templates folder because Flask (or whatever) looks for the templates in the templates folder,
Then the style.css should be in the static folder along with the photos used for customization(I did not include the media, plus I know this isn't the right lace to place the media but I kept getting a 404 on my terminal)
I think y'all know how it go.
